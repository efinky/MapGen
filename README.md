MapGen
======

playing around with randomized tile-based map generation.

I started this project to learn ruby and gosu and play around with simple generation algorithms and to play around with different game desgin ideas as well as get a handle on ruby's strengths and weaknesses.
I apologize to any ruby experts, I only used ruby for the first time a month and a half ago.  The expereince of programming ruby has been enlightening.



Movement - numpad or arrow keys

numpad0 and numpad5 (and 'q'/'w') toggle between different types of tile views - standard (each "grass" tile looks the same) and randomized (randomly chooses between slightly different tiles)
